# Node.js Server Unresponsiveness: Long-Running Synchronous Operation

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Node.js where a long-running synchronous operation within a request handler can cause the server to hang or become unresponsive.  The problem stems from Node.js's single-threaded, event-driven architecture.  A blocking operation prevents the event loop from processing other requests or events.

The `server.js` file contains the problematic code. The `serverSolution.js` file provides a solution using asynchronous operations.

## How to reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `node server.js`.
3. Access the server in a web browser.  You'll likely see the server respond very slowly or not at all.
4. Run `node serverSolution.js` after killing the first instance. You'll notice a significant improvement in responsiveness.

## Solution:

The key to resolving this issue is to avoid blocking the event loop. Use asynchronous operations (e.g., callbacks, promises, async/await) to handle long-running tasks. This allows other events to be processed while the long-running task is in progress.
